              <p>They're not Arnold Schwarzenegger's company, but close in terms of location.</p>
              <p>Planet Labs is an up and coming San Fransisco-based satellite imagery and software startup, a company planning to take the planet by photograph. Through deployment of miniature satellites called "Doves", imaging satellites that pictures of the earth daily,
              the company hopes to provide not only commercial but humanitarian and environmental value to the globe.</p>
              <p>Planet labs plans to provide four different sectors with daily satellite imagery: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Agriculture</li>
                <li>Natural Resources</li>
                <li>Government</li>
                <li>Geospatial</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In addition, the startup hopes to provide data to applications such as: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Logistics</li>
                <li>Construction Site Development</li>
                <li>Crop Monitoring</li>
                <li>Urbanization</li>
                <li>Natural Resources</li>
                <li>Asset Management</li>

            <div class="funding">
            <h3>Funding</h3>
              <p>A recent round of funding added $70 million to Planet Lab's capital, bringing its total value to $160.1 million.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="hardware">
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
              <p>The first launch of "Doves" saw a flock of 28 satellites launched into Earth's low orbit. </p>
              <p>Each dove completes a full circle around the planet in approximately 90 minutes, capturing images as they travel.</p>
              <p>The dove then connects with an affliated ground station, sending images and migrating them to the cloud pipeline, as well as receiving additional instructions</p>
            </div>

            <div class="software">
            <h3>Software Infrastructure</h3>
              <p>The company is currently developing the Planet Labs automated pipeline for customers to quickly grab imagery and data from the flocks. This pipeline consists of web applications and APIs seamlessly connected to the doves.</p>
              <p>Planet Lab's pipeline utilizes the following: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Cloud-based API delivery system written in Python and C.</li>
                  <li>PostgreSQL Database.</li>
                  <li>Web/Mobile support.</li>
