Games that utilize a farming/grinding system for achievement generally encourage automation and process optimization for the game users.

Think about it, there's a set number of processes that gamers have to go through over and over again in these games. Similar to boring tasks, but made less boring with chances for achievement. This might explain why many developers are also gamers(well, that and modern gaming and development rose together). There's plenty of processes to learn from playing task-based video games.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
