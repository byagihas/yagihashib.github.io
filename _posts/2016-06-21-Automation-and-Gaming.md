Welcome to my empty Jekyll blog!

Just wanted to get my first post up and running so this doesn't look like a ghost town...

I'll leave a thought here for my future curiosity:

Games that utilize a farming/grinding system for achievement generally encourage automation and process optimization for the game users.

Think about it, there's a set number of processes that gamers have to go through over and over again in these games. Similar to boring tasks, but made less boring with chances for achievement. This might explain why many developers are also gamers(well, that and modern gaming and development rose together). There's plenty of processes to learn from playing task-based video games.

Grind over and over again, or grind once or twice and improve. Make it faster, more efficient, sleeker.
